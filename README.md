# Weather-App
Weather App for Pixelnebula interview

Implemented and working;

- Press enter to submit.
- Press escape to start over.
- Added basic background images and classes to submit.
- Basic Styling.
- Added focus to input box on load and escape press.
- Improved background positioning.
- Added back button so phone had a back option.
- Added logo

Known Problems;

- Missing CSS classes for smoke, drizzle & mist.
- South Pole directs to North Pole.
- random strings don't display an error, rather the page just sits idle.

Current ideas to move the project forwards;

- Better background images.
- Background image animation/transition (make it less jumpy).
- implement more weather classes for more relevant background images.
- Some sort of design for the front page.
- Share feature for social media.
- recent Instagram images from the searched area.

I'm open to any other suggestions on functionality.
