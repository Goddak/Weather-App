# WeatherStatus.com

This project is a request by Pixelnebula to demonstrate my current JavaScript ability.
Whilst I have tried in the past to learn JavaScript, this project and my "Learning" JavaScript has all been since Thursday 9th July 2015 (one week before the submit date). I have put a couple of hours each day towards learning and making this project. After figuring out the basics of JavaScript, I found using/learning jQuery was much easier and it has helped me in pushing the project forwards.

This is not considered finished, I have however run out of time to continue before submission. Here are the bugs I've noticed;

- Missing CSS classes & images for smoke, drizzle & mist.
- South Pole directs to North Pole.

The most recently implemented changes are;

- Basic Styling.
- Added logo.
- Added focus to input box on load and escape press.
- Used .cod to retrieve 404 error from API.
- Added .fadeIn and .fadeOut with .delay to reduce jumpiness between states.
- Used setTimeout to stop background loading too soon
- Random strings now create an error, rather than the page sitting idle.

Current ideas to move the project forwards;

- Improved background images.
- Background image, like www.rainymood.com.
- Use weatherResults.weather.id to implement more specific weather classes providing more relevant background images.
- Share feature for social media.
- Recent Instagram images of the searched area.

I'm open to any other suggestions on functionality.
